## Installation 
Download the zip file of this repo, unpack it into this directory "%userprofile%/.qgis2/python/plugins" 
using the plugin folder name "html_image_map_creator". 

Copy all files from the "src" directory into the main directory of the plugin. Otherwise QGIS won't be able to detect them.

Following this, you can (re)start QGIS and run the plugin from the menu "Web > HTML Image Map Creator > Create map...".
